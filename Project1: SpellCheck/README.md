### Project 1: SpellCheck

This project involves creating a hash table class in C++ that is used to load a "dictionary" and spell check a "document". The program processes valid words from a text file, checks if they are in the dictionary using the hash table, and reports unrecognized or too-long words. The project includes implementing either linear probing or double hashing for collision resolution and uses a user-defined hash table class. The program outputs results, including processing times for loading the dictionary and spell checking the document.
