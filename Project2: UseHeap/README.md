# Project 2: UseHeap

This project implements a binary heap class in C++ that manages elements with unique string IDs and associated integer keys, allowing for efficient insertion, deletion, and key updates. The heap maintains the minimum element at the root, ensuring quick access to the smallest key. It utilizes a hash table for fast lookups, enabling constant-time average operations for removal and key updates. The program includes an interactive command-line interface for users to perform various heap operations, ensuring a robust and efficient implementation of a priority queue.
