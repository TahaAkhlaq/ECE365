### Course Description
A continuation of ECE 264, also with an emphasis on practical implementation issues and good programming methodology. Topics include graphs, graph-related algorithms and dynamic programming techniques. Also an introduction to some advanced topics such as Turing machines, computability and NP-complete systems.

## Projects
- **[Project 1](Project1%3A%20SpellCheck/)**: A program that uses a custom hash table to spell check a document by comparing it against a dictionary.
- **[Project 2](Project2%3A%20UseHeap/)**: A program that implements a binary heap to efficiently manage elements with unique IDs and keys in a priority queue.
- **[Project 3](Project3%3A%20Dijkstra/)**: A program that uses custom heap and hash table classes to implement Dijkstra's algorithm for finding shortest paths in a graph.
